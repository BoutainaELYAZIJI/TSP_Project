The objective of this project is to solve the problem of the traveling salesman. It is a
mathematical problem which consists, given a set of cities separated by given distances,
in finding the shortest path which connects all the cities.
We have implemented several methods to try to solve this problem :<br/> an exact method
represented by dynamic programming as well as another metaheuristic method (GVNS).
